# Service Security Takeaways

## Information Entropy
1. Privacy vs Security (Panopticon (Psychologically affect humans))
2. Information Security: Base 6 usage, can be used to represent a larger set of numbers. 
3. The difficulty of compression: explain (Information is more valuabe based on how compressable it is/ not how meaningful it is to me)
4. Predictability & Compressability define the Entropy of Information
5. Wheather (atmospheric noise) -> the best way to randomize information
6. Zipf Law (use this law to see what is the entrop of a password for the most common words (20%))
7. Check what sites are using to check the password?


## Information Integrity
1. Constants can be initialized with a variable
2. Write your test first
3. Tests are a contract between your clients and your organization
4. Follow Test Driven Development (TDD)
5. Just write code that passes the tests
6. You make your code more beautiful after you have passed your tests
7. Analyze the problem, pass your tests, then write beautiful code
8. (Protobuffer):  to send very compressed data; very different from the transferring of JSON and XML types
9. Jumpee - Atom's plugin to jump around your code
10. [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) - to check your code for violation of syntax uses in Ruby
11. Ruby methods are great (readable) if 5 lines of code are used.
12. Map / Reduce to iterate over arrays, etc., instead of for loops.
13. In order to understand how to get the most optimized code you must run benchmarks

Bonus:
``` ruby
# Metaprogramming
attr_accessor
```
